# pants_on_fire

## Description

In this programming assignment, I implemented the game Pants on Fire. In this game, the user maneuvers a firefighter as it moves around the map putting out fire with his water hose. The user wins by putting out all of the fire and loses if he sustains enough damage from the fire.

## Goals

## The following are what I learned from the project:

<ol>
    <li>
        Learn to instantiate and use methods from provided classes based on their documentation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Understand the difference between static and non-static class methods.
    </li>
    <li>
        Organized my code into classes for modularity and code re-usability.
    </li>
    <li>
        Become more familiar with the architecture of real-time simulations and games.
    </li>
    <li>
        Gain experience using ArrayList collections of different object types.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a basic computer game that can be expanded with many fun new features.
    </li>
</ol>
